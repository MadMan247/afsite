## Acid Fog, Live at the Depths Backyard

We were prepared for the absolute worst. We didn't think we would even make it halfway through the set without the police shutting us down.  
We were actually going to make a small documentary if it went south, but luckily it didn’t come to that.

...

A self-hosted concert, taking place in the backyard of a Dawson, Illinois household where the members of Acid Fog practiced.

A grand event was planned, with merchandise and food for sale — but ultimately, the neighborhood complained to the government, and the government basically said *“go fuck yourself.”*  
So merch wasn't allowed to be sold, and food could only be given away if it was low risk (like water bottles and bags of chips).  
Rather than a concert, the event had to be treated like a personal party.

The neighborhood/Home Owner’s Association didn’t stop there.  
At least one local submitted a **noise complaint before the concert even started**, claiming it would last until 2 A.M. and that the whole neighborhood would be trashed.

The police did show up mid-concert and allegedly said they were *“just waiting for a second complaint”* to act — but no other reports came in.  
Maybe the cop was just extremely chill. Who knows.  
**The concert continued without interruption.**

### 🎥 Recording

This performance was recorded in **1080p HD** using a Microsoft Lifecam webcam.  
Maybe one day that footage will be released — here's a snippet for now:
