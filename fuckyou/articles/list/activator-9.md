In this issue of *Activator Magazine* (Issue #63), Activator (Carol Weems) asked the members of Acid Fog several questions pertaining to their music, tastes, and the members' hobbies outside of the music scene.

Before their interview questions are shown, a brief paragraph describing Acid Fog states:

"Acid Fog is practically an infant on the Springfield scene, but the doom/psych rock trio really came out kicking."
