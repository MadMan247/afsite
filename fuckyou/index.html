            <p>Acid Fog, founded in a secluded garage in Mechanicsburg, Illinois, is a band with a primary focus on doom metal, but freely dabbles in any genre, creating timeless classics. A three-piece crew with band lead Ethan Wright, Bassist Clint Schrader, and Drummer Connor Cappitelli. Inspiration from Van Halen, Mephistofeles, Primus, Electric Wizard, Acid Mammoth, Pentagram, Nirvana, and many many others. The eclectic three combine their passion into a truly wonderful musical feast.</p>

            <p>Ethan Wright is the man behind many of the tasteful flyers and designs assosciated with Acid Fog. Still, some of the logos were created by others for use by Acid Fog. Many flyers that come from Dumb Records shows are made courtesy of Dumb Records, but that shouldn't take away from the legendarily gloomy and sinister concoctions that sway even the heaviest of viewers.</p>
