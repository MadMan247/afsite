The description from BandCamp reads:
"long ago in the years of 1978-79... after a violent mass shooting following a dispute over a checkers game - that killed 2 of our studio engineers and our mastering guy - these were the only demos to be salvaged from the bloody remains of our studio. Most songs soon to be recorded for full studio albums... some won't be so lucky"[^1]
