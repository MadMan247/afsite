Dumb records, a primary part of the Acid Fog repertoire, an asylum filled with musical interest, emboldened by a bright green elephant that sits in front of their "new" location downtown.

Previously the "Black Sheep", a big name in the Springfield music scene that first opened in 2014, they moved to downtown Springfield on March 9th, 2019, holding a ribbon cutting with the Chili Bowl Mullet Man.

Currently, Dumb Recs holds plenty of interest in the Acid Fog world, from selling Acid Fog CDs, potentially selling Acid Fog cassettes in the near future, having Acid Fog on to play shows at least three times in a single year, Dumb Records has cemented itself as a certified hood classic, both as a record store, venue, and overall chill place to hang.

Previously they were tenants of George, the owner of Skank Skates and the old Black Sheep’s building. George also hosted the Midwest Trade Expo at Centennial Park that Acid Fog performed at. What a small world.
