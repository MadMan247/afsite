## Midwest Trade Expo Acid Fog Performance

While skaters shredded at the Centennial Park skatepark, Ethan shredded on his guitar, Connor shredded his drumsticks, and Clint shredded his fingers.

Centennial Park, Springfield IL â€” a *Midwest Trade Expo* event hosted by George Sinclair, the man, the myth, the ~~bald~~ **bold**.  
After the Acid Fog show at Skank Skates (which George also owns), he asked Acid Fog to perform at his Skate Park event, alongside Black Queen.  
However, Black Queen didnâ€™t end up performing as they were down a guitarist.

There was plenty at the event: vendors, food, clothing, merch â€” but there were certainly a lot of skateboarders, unsurprisingly, since the event was at a skatepark (again, Georgeâ€™s connection to Skank Skates shines through).

While it wasn't uncomfortably hot, the sun had a particularly *radiative* quality.  
Everything in sunlight got toasted, including the band members:
- Ethan was **pretty sunburnt**
- Connor was **lightly sunburnt**
- Clint was **practically unharmed**

The computer and camera recording the show also got rather hot.  
An attempt was made to use empty plastic bags to keep the equipment cool, but it was also a rather windy day.

### Performance Details

- **Date**: September 9th, 2023
- **Time**: Started at ~2:20 PM CST, ended at 4:35 PM CST
- **Notes**:  
  The video says "SHUTTER" throughout because the camera has both high-speed and regular shutter modes.  
  Since the camera wasnâ€™t officially recording, the shutter notice appeared.  
  Using the regular shutter wouldâ€™ve overexposed the footage â€” any white flashes are likely from switching shutter modes.
