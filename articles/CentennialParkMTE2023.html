            <!-- article content goes here -->
            <p>Centennial Park, Springfield IL. A Midwest Trade Expo event hosted by George Sinclair, the man the myth, the <s>bald</s> bold. After the Acid Fog show at Skank Skates (George owns Skank Skates too), George asked Acid Fog to perform at his Skate Park event, along with Black Queen. Though, as they were down a guitarist, Black Queen did not end up performing at the event. </p>
            <p>There was plenty at the event: vendors, food, clothing, merch, but there were certainly a lot of skateboarders, which was not surprising considering where the event took place, at the Skatepark, which is again where Georgeâ€™s connection to Skank Skates comes in.
</p>
<p>While it wasn't an uncomforably hot day, the sun did have a particularly radiative quality. Everything in sunlight got toasted, including the bandmembers. Ethan was pretty sunburnt, connor was lightly sunburnt, and clint was practically unharmed. The computer and camera recording the show also got rather hot. I attempted to use empty plastic bags to keep the computer and the power supply for the camera cool, but it was also a rather windy day.</p>

            <p>Let's put down some facts just so that this article is a bit more informative: Acid Fog performed on September 9th, 2023. They began playing at approx. 2:20 P.M. local time (CST), and stopped performing at 4:35 P.M. The video says &quot;SHUTTER&quot; throughout, because the video camera has both high-speed and regular shutter options. The SHUTTER would typically not be shown when recording, but technically I am not recording according to the camera, so it shows up anyways. If I were to use the regular shutter speed, you would not be able to see much except for white. If you see a white flash in the video, it is probably from me changing it to regular shutter for a moment.</p>
