            <h2>Acid Fog, Live at the Depths Backyard</h2>
            <p>We were prepared for the absolute worst. We didn't think we would even make it half way through the set without the police shutting us down. We were actually going to make a small documentary if it went south, but luckily it didn't come to that.</p>

            <p>A self-hosted concert, taking place in the backyard of a Dawson, Illinois household that the members of Acid Fog practiced at.</p>
            <p>A grande event was planned, with merchandise and food for sale, but ultimately the neighborhood complained to the government, and the government said &quot;fuck yourself&quot; so instead that did not happen. Merch was not allowed to be sold, and food was only allowed to be given away if it was low risk, such as water bottles and bags of chips. Rather than a concert, it was to be treated as a personal party of sorts.</p>
            <p>The neighborhood / Home Owner’s Association didn’t stop there; at least one member of the surrounding area submitted a noise complaint before the concert even started, and claimed that the concert was going to last until 2 A.M., everyone was going to be hammered, and it was otherwise extremely loud. The police did show up mid concert, and allegedly stated that he was there waiting for a second noise complaint so that he could action. Thankfully, the cop was very understanding, and no other noise complaints were reported. Maybe. Maybe the cop was just extremely chill. I don’t know. The concert continued without interruption.</p>
            <p>This performance was also recorded in full HD 1080p via a Microsoft Lifecam Web Cam. Maybe one day that footage will be released. Here's a snippet for now.</p>

                <li>Spiraling</li>
                <li>Cover of a Mephistofeles song, Transylvanian Funeral</li>

                <li>Original Jam</li>
                <li>Psychotic Break From Reality / The Gentle Return</li>
                <li>Cover of a Mephistofeles song, Black Sunday</li>
                <li>Shoelacer</li>
                <li>Dying for Satan</li>
            </ol>
