    <h1>WHO MADE THIS SITE???????"???1/1/12//</h1>

    <p>This was a lengthy learning effort, as I tried to expand the features and functionality of the site. I have a bunch of random CSS files, I have a poorly organized index layout, and many other mistakes were made. My buddy Daryk also helped, but mostly with stupid things like that dumbass hover preview on the homepage and <span style="text-decoration:dashed underline;"title="The trivia worked already, this mf goat just took a turd and polished it">the trivia page.</span> In all reality, he helped me polish many features.</p>

    <p>I record + edit videos for Acid Fog, I host they shit, I made this website (it's not my best work, tbf)</p>

    <p> I love simple things. Like HTML. And CSS. JavaScript is usually excessive. Yes, I intended for this website to give a 2010 energy that the netizens of web 3 just don't like.</p>
    <p>PLUH!</p>
